# Ansible Collection - etalab.api_infrastructure

This collection is currently used by the following projects:

- [Auth-api](https://github.com/betagouv/api-auth)

The aim is to share the best roles found in every Etalab project, to make them re-usable and easy to use.

## How ready is the role?

- 0 = not sharable
- 1 = variables are defaulted
- 2 = there is a README.md
- 3 = there is an arguments spec
- 4 = the role is tested with molecule
- 5 = the role is tested with e2e test (provisioning actual machines like https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml)
